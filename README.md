Database created in SQL Server Management Studio with C# interface.  There will be a database which an number of plants will be entered and more later can be found in the C# interface. It is easy for people who have difficulty working with SQL. Will be, as well, a list of plants and more details about.
First of all, I made this project to sort movies in a list with length, more info about movies and so on. Then I used the same project and modified it into a plant/tea sorter.
